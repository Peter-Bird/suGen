# Contributing to YourGoProject

We appreciate your interest in contributing to YourGoProject! Whether it's reporting a bug, discussing the current state of the code, submitting a fix, proposing new features, or becoming a maintainer, all contributions are welcome.

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## GitHub Flow

All code changes happen through pull requests. To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Write clear, logical, and performant code. Please adhere to the [Go coding standards](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
3. Ensure any new code is accompanied by relevant tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, or added new ones, update the documentation accordingly.
5. Make sure the tests pass (`go test ./...`).
6. Lint your code (`golint`) and ensure it's formatted (`gofmt -s`).
7. Submit your pull request.

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the Same License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [LICENSE](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's Issues

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/YourGoProject/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Write Detailed Bug Reports

A good bug report includes:

- A summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce. Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happens.
- Any additional information (e.g., why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work).

## Coding Style

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- Use `go fmt` for formatting your code.
- Keep line lengths reasonable.
- Avoid package-level globals.
